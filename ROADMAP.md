# Roadmap (Semester Plan)

## Phase 1 — Foundations (Weeks 1–2)
- Confirm server room resources and access model
- Finalize requirements (functional + non-functional)
- Draft architecture + network segmentation design
- Decide tooling direction (SIEM + telemetry + sensors)
- Establish documentation + evidence standards

## Phase 2 — Build MVP Range Pod (Weeks 3–5)
Goal: one working “pod” that proves end-to-end operation.
- Stand up core services (AD/DNS, file, baseline workstation(s))
- Deploy telemetry (Windows + Linux + network sensor)
- Ingest logs into SIEM and validate searches/dashboards
- Implement MITRE Caldera baseline (controlled)
- Create Scenario Template and execute Scenario 001 with evidence

## Phase 3 — Scale + Scenario Library (Weeks 6–10)
- Expand from MVP pod toward ~30 VMs baseline
- Add additional enterprise services (web/db/apps)
- Build detection pack (baseline alerts + dashboards)
- Expand scenario library (3–8+ scenarios) with validation evidence
- Improve reset/rebuild process and operational runbooks

## Phase 4 — Hardening + Handoff + Presentation (Weeks 11–14)
- Finalize runbooks (access, reset, rebuild, classroom usage)
- Finalize diagrams (logical + physical + dataflows)
- Finalize documentation for future teams (handoff package)
- Prepare board/client presentation deliverables and demo plan

## Deliverables (board-ready)
- Architecture + network segmentation package
- Tooling recommendation + rationale
- Working cyber range environment with documented build steps
- Scenario library with evidence and expected detections
- Operations runbook + reset/rebuild procedures
