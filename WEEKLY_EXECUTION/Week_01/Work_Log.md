# Week_01 — Work Log

## Overview
Week 01 focused on re-establishing project scope from last semester, reviewing prior deliverables (Splunk-based prototype), clarifying long-term vision, and aligning expectations with faculty. This week set the foundation for the transition from proof-of-concept to scalable cyber range architecture.

---

# Tasks

- [x] Review prior semester deliverables (Splunk prototype, topology, presentation)
- [x] Define long-term cyber range vision (student-driven + faculty-adoptable)
- [x] Establish GitHub repository structure
- [x] Create initial documentation framework
- [x] Outline semester execution roadmap
- [x] Identify primary stakeholders

---

## Task Details

### Review Prior Deliverables

- Reviewed Splunk-based monitoring prototype
- Evaluated previous VM layout (Kali attacker, Ubuntu target, Splunk server)
- Identified strengths:
  - Functional telemetry ingestion
  - Working alerting pipeline
- Identified limitations:
  - Not modular
  - Not scalable to 30+ VMs
  - Not structured for repeatable classroom scenarios

---

### Define Long-Term Vision

Established project direction:

- Student-driven research cyber range
- Faculty-adoptable curriculum tool
- Real-world SOC workflow simulation
- Scenario-based learning model
- Sustainable architecture beyond one semester

Confirmed transition from “lab demo” to “institutional training environment.”

---

### Establish GitHub Repository Structure

Created structured folders:

- `/DOCUMENTATION`
- `/ECRL_SUBMISSION`
- `/WEEKLY_EXECUTION`
- `/SCENARIOS`
- `/DIAGRAMS`
- `/RUNBOOKS`

Ensured repository supports:

- Clear documentation separation
- Long-term maintainability
- Future cohort onboarding

---

### Create Initial Documentation Framework

Drafted foundational files:

- `02_requirements.md`
- `03_architecture-draft.md`
- Initial README structure
- Stakeholder question placeholders
- Work log structure template

Established documentation-first approach.

---

### Outline Semester Execution Roadmap

Defined major semester phases:

1. Infrastructure clarification (ECRL constraints)
2. Deployment request submission
3. Core environment build
4. Initial scenario implementation
5. Detection engineering refinement
6. Faculty validation package
7. Presentation + conference preparation

---

### Identify Stakeholders

Primary stakeholders identified:

- ECRL / Marist IT
- Central Hudson
- Faculty (Prof. DeCusatis / Prof. Foti)
- Students (future users)

Established need for structured communication strategy.

# Meeting Notes

## Summary

- Reconfirmed continuation of cyber range initiative.
- Clarified expansion goal beyond prior Splunk demo.
- Emphasized need for scalability and sustainability.
- Identified requirement for formal ECRL deployment process.
- Confirmed semester deliverables must support both technical and academic evaluation.

---

## Action Items

- Draft stakeholder questions for each group.
- Prepare initial ECRL deployment scope outline.
- Formalize semester timeline through May.
- Begin drafting architecture documentation.
- Prepare for Central Hudson engagement.

---

# Risks / Blockers

- Unknown ECRL infrastructure limits.
- Hypervisor platform not yet confirmed.
- VLAN provisioning process unclear.
- Storage capacity and snapshot policy unknown.
- Central Hudson expectations not yet defined.

---

# Artifacts Produced

- Initial GitHub repository structure
- Draft architecture documentation
- Requirements outline
- Stakeholder identification notes
- Semester phase outline
- Work log template framework
