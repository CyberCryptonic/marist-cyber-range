# Marist Cyber Range (SOC Build & Ops)

## Purpose
This repository is the official documentation and project hub for building a reusable cyber range for Marist University. The goal is a scalable environment (30+ VMs baseline) that supports SOC-style monitoring, scenario-based training, and long-term handoff to future student teams.

## Stakeholders
- Marist University Cybersecurity Program
- Partner: Central Hudson (Poughkeepsie, NY)
- Faculty Advisor: Dominick Foti
- Student Team: Nate Pena, Erick Perez, Ryan Clark, & Benjamin Brandt

## What we are building (Semester Scope)
- Range architecture designed for ~30 VMs with future scaling
- Network segmentation (zones/VLANs) and safe isolation boundaries
- Central telemetry pipeline (endpoint + server + identity + network)
- SIEM + detections (tooling decision pending)
- Scenario library (repeatable execution + expected detections + evidence)
- Operations runbooks (reset/rebuild, access model, class usage)

## Repo Structure (where everything lives)
- `/docs/` — official documentation (requirements, architecture, network, operations)
- `/scenarios/` — scenario playbooks (setup → execution → expected telemetry → evidence → reset)
- `/diagrams/` — architecture/topology/dataflow diagrams
- `/evidence/` — screenshots/logs proving builds and detections
- `/references/` — Zotero/BibTeX export and citation notes

## How we work (Definition of Done)
An item is only “Done” when:
- Documentation is updated in `/docs/` (or scenario file in `/scenarios/`)
- Evidence is attached in `/evidence/` (screenshots/logs/notes)
- A teammate reviews and comments “Reviewed” on the issue
